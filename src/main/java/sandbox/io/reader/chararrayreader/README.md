## 🔍 Method Usage Summary

| Method | Purpose | Real-World Use |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `CharArrayReader(char[])` | Wraps a char array in a Reader | Load config/data already in memory |
| `read()` | Reads one character | Simple parsing/tokenizing |
| `read(char[], off, len)` | Batch read to buffer | Efficient reading in chunks |
| `read(char[])` | Reads into entire buffer | Used in I/O adapters |
| `skip(long n)` | Skip unwanted chars | Skip headers or known prefixes |
| `mark(int limit)` | Save current read position | Needed for lookahead parsing |
| `reset()` | Rewind to last marked point | Retry parsing |
| `ready()` | Check readiness (always true) | Useful in stream orchestration |
| `close()` | Disable further use | Signals cleanup even without resources |

## 💡 Final Tip for Enterprise Devs

> Use `CharArrayReader` when you have **character data already in memory**, and need to pass it into libraries that expect a `Reader`—like XML parsers, test fixtures, or streaming processors. It’s lightweight, fast, and doesn’t depend on external resources.
