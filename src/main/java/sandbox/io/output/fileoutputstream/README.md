## ðŸ“˜ Short Explanations by Method

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| `write(int b)` | Writes a single byte â€” rarely used due to performance. |
| `write(byte[] b)` | Writes entire byte array â€” typical for most data. |
| `write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` | Writes a portion of a byte array â€” great for stream-based or partial processing. |
| `flush()` | Pushes data from buffer to system (used with wrappers like `BufferedOutputStream`). |
| `close()` | Closes the stream â€” done automatically via try-with-resources. |
| `getFD()` | Accesses low-level OS file handle â€” enables sync or interop. |
| `FileOutputStream(File/FileDescriptor/String)` | Constructors â€” let you control how and where to write. |
| `FileOutputStream(File, boolean append)` | Lets you append data instead of overwriting. |
| `FileDescriptor.sync()` | Ensures data is committed to physical storage (advanced durability use case). |

## ðŸ’¼ Enterprise Dev Tips

- **Always use try-with-resources** to prevent resource leaks.
- **Use append mode** for logs, audit trails, and incremental writes.
- **Wrap with BufferedOutputStream** when writing large data chunks.
- **Donâ€™t use for text output directly** â€” wrap with `OutputStreamWriter` if you need encoding control.
- **Validate paths and catch IOExceptions gracefully** â€” files can disappear or permissions can change in enterprise environments.
