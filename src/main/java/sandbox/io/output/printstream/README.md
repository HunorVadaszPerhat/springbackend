# ‚úÖ **Quick Overview of Each Method Demonstrated**
| Method | Practical Use | 
|:---|:---|
| `print()` | Basic printing without newline (e.g., building dynamic lines). |
| `println()` | Quick output of complete lines (most common for logs, diagnostics). |
| `printf()` / `format()` | Structured, formatted text (important for clean logs, reports). |
| `append()` | Fluent API style or selective text building. |
| `write()` | Rare use for raw byte writing (normally for binary output or custom encoding). |
| `flush()` | Forcing output immediately (important in real-time apps). |
| `checkError()` | Verifying if a problem occurred during output. |
| `close()` | Clean resource management (always close streams except System.out/err). |

---

# ‚ö° Real-World Usage Focus:

- In **enterprise apps**, you mostly use **`println`**, **`printf`**, **`flush`**, and sometimes **`checkError`**.
- **Avoid `write()` unless dealing with low-level byte operations**.
- **Always specify UTF-8 encoding** when writing to external destinations (files, network streams).

# üì¢ Final Advice for Enterprise Developers

| ‚úÖ Best Practices | ‚ùå Common Pitfalls |
|:---|:---|
| Prefer `printf`/`format` for structured logs. | Do **not** manually close `System.out` or `System.err`. |
| Always `flush()` after important outputs (e.g., real-time logs). | Don't rely on `write()` unless you know how encoding works. |
| Use `checkError()` for critical outputs (e.g., reporting). | Don't assume printing always succeeds without checking. |
| Specify encoding explicitly (UTF-8) when opening files. | Avoid platform-default encodings ‚Äî leads to bugs on different machines. |
