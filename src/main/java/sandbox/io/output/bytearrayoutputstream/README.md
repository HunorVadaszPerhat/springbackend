### ðŸ’¡ **What This Project Demonstrates**
| **Method**                          | **Use Case** |
|------------------------------------|--------------|
| `write(int b)`                     | Writing a single byte. |
| `write(byte[])`                    | Writing a full array. |
| `write(byte[], off, len)`         | Writing part of an array. |
| `size()`                           | Tracking how much data was written. |
| `toByteArray()`                    | Retrieving a copy of the written data. |
| `toString(Charset)`               | Getting text from the stream with encoding. |
| `toString(String charsetName)`    | Alternative string conversion. |
| `writeTo(OutputStream)`           | Sending data to another stream. |
| `reset()`                          | Reusing the same stream. |
| `flush()`                          | Required by interface, but does nothing. |
| `close()`                          | Also a no-op, doesnâ€™t release any resources. |

### ðŸ§  Final Tips for Enterprise Developers

- Use `reset()` for buffer reuse in performance-sensitive systems (e.g., web APIs).
- Avoid `toString()` without a charsetâ€”**always specify encoding**.
- Prefer `writeTo()` over `toByteArray()` when sending data downstream to avoid unnecessary copies.
- Don't rely on `close()` or `flush()`â€”theyâ€™re only there for compatibility.
- If high throughput or concurrency is critical, consider an **unsynchronized custom buffer** or libraries like **Apache Commons IO**.
