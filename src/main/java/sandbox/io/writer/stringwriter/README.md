## ðŸ§  Method Summary & Explanation

| Method                                  | Purpose                                                                 | Typical Use Case                                  |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `StringWriter()`                        | Creates writer with default buffer size                                 | Small content or when size unknown                |
| `StringWriter(int initialSize)`        | Sets initial buffer capacity                                            | Large predictable data (e.g., reports)            |
| `write(int c)`                         | Writes a single character (Unicode code point)                         | Fine-grained control, usually not critical        |
| `write(char[], int, int)`              | Writes part of a character array                                        | Efficient bulk write                              |
| `write(String)`                        | Writes full string                                                      | Most common usage                                 |
| `write(String, int, int)`              | Writes substring                                                        | Useful for partial inserts                        |
| `append(CharSequence)`                 | Appends a sequence (e.g., `StringBuilder`)                              | Fluent APIs, readable code                        |
| `append(CharSequence, int, int)`       | Appends a subsequence                                                   | Selective string writing                          |
| `append(char)`                         | Appends a single character                                              | Syntax building, fluent chaining                  |
| `toString()`                           | Converts all written text to a String                                   | Extract final result                              |
| `getBuffer()`                          | Access internal `StringBuffer`                                          | Rareâ€”only for advanced manipulation               |
| `flush()`                              | No-op (for compatibility)                                               | Use when generic API expects it                   |
| `close()`                              | No-op (keeps working after close)                                       | Safe with `try-with-resources` if needed          |

## ðŸ“Œ Final Notes for Enterprise Developers

- Use `StringWriter` for assembling strings before sending them to logs, responses, or databases.
- It's ideal for use with `PrintWriter`, `JAXB`, or `String templates`.
- For large or high-concurrency tasks, consider alternatives like `StringBuilder`, `CharArrayWriter`, or third-party streaming libraries.
