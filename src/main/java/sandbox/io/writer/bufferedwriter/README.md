## üìå Tips for Enterprise Developers

- Use **try-with-resources** to avoid forgetting `close()`.
- Call `flush()` manually only if partial content must be visible *before* the writer is closed (e.g., during network streaming).
- For writing structured data (logs, reports), combine `write()` and `newLine()` for line-based formats.
- Consider custom buffer sizes for large file generation ‚Äî test and tune for your workloads.
