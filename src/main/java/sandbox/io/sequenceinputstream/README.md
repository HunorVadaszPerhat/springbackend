# âœ¨ **Short Explanation for Each Method:**

| Method | Demonstration | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `SequenceInputStream(InputStream s1, InputStream s2)` | `sisTwoStreams` creation | Joins two streams easily. |
| `SequenceInputStream(Enumeration<? extends InputStream> e)` | `sisEnumeration` creation | Joins multiple streams dynamically. |
| `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` | Inside `readAndPrintStream()` loop | Efficiently reads bytes into a buffer. |
| `available()` | After reading everything | Shows remaining bytes (only current stream!). |
| `markSupported()` | After reading | Always `false`; mark/reset is unsupported. |
| `skip(long n)` | After reading | Skips bytes (though at end, so skips 0). |
| `close()` | Handled by try-with-resources | Closes streams automatically, crucial for avoiding leaks. |

# ðŸŽ¯ **Final Developer Tips for Enterprise Usage:**
- **Always** wrap `SequenceInputStream` in `try-with-resources` to auto-close streams.
- **Prefer** the constructor with `Enumeration` for *dynamic numbers of streams* (like merging many small files).
- **Remember**: `mark/reset` is unsupported â€” design your reading logic accordingly.
- **When skipping large data**, you may want to manually read/discard instead of using `skip()` for more control.
