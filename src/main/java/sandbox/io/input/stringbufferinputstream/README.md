# ðŸ”¥ Quick Explanation for Each Method (in code comments):

| Method | Usage Example | Explanation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Constructor | `new StringBufferInputStream(buffer)` | Creates a stream from a StringBuffer. |
| `read()` | `inputStream.read()` | Reads one byte at a time; returns -1 when finished. |
| `read(byte[], off, len)` | `inputStream.read(byteArray, 0, byteArray.length)` | Reads multiple bytes into an array for efficiency. |
| `skip(long n)` | `inputStream.skip(2)` | Skips the next 2 characters. |
| `available()` | `inputStream.available()` | Tells how many bytes are left to read. |
| `reset()` | `inputStream.reset()` | Resets reading back to the beginning. |
| `close()` | `inputStream.close()` | Closes the stream (no-op for this class). |

# ðŸŽ¯ Final Tips for Plain Java Developers

- Always wrap `InputStream` usage in `try-with-resources` to handle closing automatically.
- Avoid using `StringBufferInputStream` in real-world production (this is purely educational) â€” use `StringReader` or properly encoded `ByteArrayInputStream`.
- Pay special attention to **encoding issues**: `StringBufferInputStream` truncates Unicode, which is dangerous in multilingual apps.
- Prefer using newer APIs that respect `Charset`, especially for enterprise globalization.
