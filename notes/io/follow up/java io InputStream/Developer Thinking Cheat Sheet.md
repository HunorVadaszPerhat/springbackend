# ðŸ§  Java Developer Thinking Cheat Sheet

## 1. Problem Understanding
- What is the **exact problem** Iâ€™m solving?
- Can I **explain the problem simply** without touching code?

## 2. Responsibility & Design
- Does each **class or method do exactly one thing**? *(Single Responsibility Principle)*
- Are my **names** (classes, methods, variables) **clear and self-explanatory**?

## 3. Data and State Management
- Who **owns** the data?
- Should the data be **immutable** to avoid accidental changes?

## 4. Control Flow and Logic
- Is the logic **simple, predictable, and linear**?
- Did I avoid **deep nesting** and **complex conditions**?

## 5. Error Handling
- What can **go wrong** here?
- Am I **handling errors explicitly**, logging clearly, and not hiding problems?

## 6. Memory and Resources
- Am I **closing resources** properly (streams, DB connections, sockets)?
- Did I **prevent memory overuse** by avoiding huge object loading?

## 7. Abstraction and Layers
- Am I **hiding unnecessary complexity** with proper interfaces and layers?
- Are modules **loosely coupled, strongly cohesive**?

## 8. Code Reusability
- Is this code **too tightly bound** to a single case?
- Can I **reuse or extend** it without major rework?

## 9. Performance and Scalability
- Am I **optimizing actual bottlenecks**, not guessing?
- Do I **batch**, **stream**, or **cache** where needed?

## 10. Testing and Validation
- Is this code **easy to test** (small, focused units)?
- Am I **writing tests** alongside the code?

## 11. Concurrency and Safety
- Are there **multiple threads** accessing shared data?
- Have I used **synchronization, locks, atomic classes** correctly?

## 12. Security
- Have I **validated all inputs** and **sanitized outputs**?
- Am I handling **sensitive data** (passwords, tokens) securely?

## 13. Clean Code and Readability
- Will another developer **understand** this code easily?
- Have I avoided **clever tricks** in favor of **clear, boring, safe code**?

## 14. Framework/Library Best Practices
- Am I following **established patterns** for Spring, JPA, Streams, etc.?
- Did I **reuse existing libraries** rather than writing unnecessary custom code?

## 15. Maintainability
- If someone revisits this code in **6 months**, will it still **make sense**?
- Did I **document tricky areas** properly (clear comments, README if needed)?

# ðŸ“‹ Golden Rules to Always Follow

> **âœ… Solve the real problem, not just the symptom.**  
> **âœ… Write code for humans first, machines second.**  
> **âœ… Make it correct first, then make it fast.**  
> **âœ… Always think about failure cases.**  
> **âœ… Optimize for readability, maintainability, and safety.**
