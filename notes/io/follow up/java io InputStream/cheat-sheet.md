# 📜 **InputStream Family Cheat-Sheet (When to Use Which Stream)**

| 📚 **Stream**                | 🧠 **Use When You Need**                                | ⚡ **Special Tip or Gotcha**                           |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| **InputStream**               | Abstract base — never used directly.                  | Always subclassed or wrapped.                        |
| **ByteArrayInputStream**      | You have bytes **already in memory** and want to read them like a stream. | No resource closing needed — memory only! |
| **FileInputStream**           | You want to **read a file** as raw bytes.              | Always wrap with `BufferedInputStream` for performance. |
| **BufferedInputStream**       | **Speed up** reading from slow sources (disk, network).| Great for large files or slow connections.           |
| **DataInputStream**           | **Read primitives** (int, double, UTF Strings) easily. | Needs matching DataOutputStream for writing!         |
| **LineNumberInputStream**     | Track **line numbers** while reading bytes.            | Rare now; prefer `LineNumberReader` for text.         |
| **PushbackInputStream**       | **Look ahead** and **unread** bytes if needed.         | Beware buffer size limits!                           |
| **ObjectInputStream**         | **Deserialize Java objects** from a stream.           | Use carefully — Serialization is risky for security! |
| **PipedInputStream**          | **Pass data between two threads** via a stream.        | Manage synchronization carefully to avoid deadlocks. |
| **SequenceInputStream**       | **Glue multiple streams** together sequentially.      | Close all wrapped streams manually!                  |
| **StringBufferInputStream** *(Deprecated)* | NEVER. Old and broken. Use **StringReader** instead. | Only here for ancient codebases.                     |

# 🎯 **Quick Strategy Tips:**

- **Always Buffer** when dealing with real-world I/O (disk, network) → `BufferedInputStream`
- **Always Layer Carefully**: `FileInputStream` ➔ `BufferedInputStream` ➔ `DataInputStream` (for structured files).
- **Prefer Character Streams** (`Reader`) if working with text — bytes are for **binary** data!
- **Serialization (ObjectInputStream)** is **dangerous** for untrusted data — prefer safer formats like JSON, XML, or Protobuf!
