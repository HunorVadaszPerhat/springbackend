## Hierarchical Tree Diagram

```plaintext
java.io
├── InputStream (abstract)
│   ├── ByteArrayInputStream
│   ├── FileInputStream
│   ├── FilterInputStream
│   │   ├── BufferedInputStream
│   │   ├── DataInputStream
│   │   ├── LineNumberInputStream ❌ (Deprecated)

```

## Legend

- ❌ = Deprecated (not recommended for modern use)
- Solid lines represent inheritance (`extends`)
- `FilterInputStream` **decorates** other `InputStream`s
- `PipedInputStream` **connects** with `PipedOutputStream`
- `FileDescriptor` **used inside** file streams like `FileInputStream`

---

If you want to read types (int, double) or objects, you need interpretation. Otherwise, you're just dealing with plain bytes.
```plaintext
java.io
├── InputStream (abstract) -> abstract base class for reading bytes sequentially from any source (file, network, memory) 
│   ├── ByteArrayInputStream -> treats a byte array like a stream and reads memory instead of a file | good for testing and processing in-memory data
│   ├── FileInputStream -> read bytes from a file directly | suited for binary files like images or PDFs
│   ├── FilterInputStream -> decorates InputStream to add extra functionality without changing the original stream | modifying/enhancing streams
│   │   ├── BufferedInputStream -> reads chunks of bytes into memory to reduce slow I/O operations (like preloading multiple bytes for faster access) | performance optimization
│   │   ├── DataInputStream -> reads primitive types directly from a stream | no need to manually assemble bytes into usable data types
│   │   ├── LineNumberInputStream ❌ (Deprecated) -> tracks line numbers while reading | parsing, error reporting
│   │   ├── PushbackInputStream -> allows pushing back bytes into stream | useful for parsers needing lookahead and rollback
│   ├── ObjectInputStream -> restores java objects from a stream (deserializing) | object persistence, network object transfer
│   ├── PipedInputStream -> connects with PipedOutputStream to send data between two threads | thread to thread communication
│   ├── SequenceInputStream -> combines multiple InputStreams into one continuous stream (reads one stream after another stream seamlessly) | merging multiple sources
│   ├── StringBufferInputStream ❌ (Deprecated) -> reads bytes from StringBuffer
├── File (handles path/metadata only) -> acts as a path manager | handles file names, locations, and properties but does not read/write data itself | file existence, metadata, path handling
├── FileDescriptor (handles system file handles) ->  acts as a low-level system pointer to open a file, socket or device | low-level access, resource sharing
```

Good, let's stick to your table and build exactly what you asked:  
**What each class reads + whether it needs interpretation or not.**  
Simple, clean, and fully professional.

# 📚 Java IO Classes — What They Read + Do They Interpret?

```plaintext
java.io
├── InputStream (abstract)
│   ├── ByteArrayInputStream
│        → Reads raw bytes from a byte array (memory).  
        ❌ No interpretation (just bytes).
│   ├── FileInputStream
│        → Reads raw bytes from a file on disk.  
        ❌ No interpretation (just bytes).
│   ├── FilterInputStream
│        → Wraps another InputStream to modify behavior (base decorator).  
        ❌ No interpretation itself (depends on subclass).
│   │   ├── BufferedInputStream
│             → Reads raw bytes from a stream but **with buffering** for speed.  
             ❌ No interpretation (still just bytes).
│   │   ├── DataInputStream
│             → Reads raw bytes and **interprets them as Java primitive types** (int, double, boolean, etc.).  
             ✅ Yes, interprets bytes into data types.
│   │   ├── LineNumberInputStream ❌ (Deprecated)
│             → Reads raw bytes and **counts line breaks** to track line numbers.  
             ✅ Some interpretation (line counting only, bad for Unicode).
│   │   ├── PushbackInputStream
│             → Reads raw bytes but allows **pushing bytes back** for re-reading.  
             ❌ No interpretation (only stream control).
│   ├── ObjectInputStream
│        → Reads raw bytes and **reconstructs full Java objects** (deserialization).  
        ✅ Yes, interprets bytes into Java objects.
│   ├── PipedInputStream
│        → Reads raw bytes sent from another thread (via PipedOutputStream).  
        ❌ No interpretation (pure byte transfer).
│   ├── SequenceInputStream
│        → Reads raw bytes from **multiple InputStreams sequentially**.  
        ❌ No interpretation (just chaining multiple sources).
│   ├── StringBufferInputStream ❌ (Deprecated)
│        → Reads bytes from a StringBuffer **as raw bytes** (broken Unicode handling).  
        ❌ No proper interpretation (deprecated for bad design).
├── File (handles path/metadata only)
     → Represents a file or directory **path and properties**, **no content reading**.  
     ❌ Not an InputStream; no reading at all.
├── FileDescriptor (handles system file handles)
     → Represents a low-level system resource (open file, socket, device).  
     ❌ No reading itself; just a reference to an open resource.
```

# 🧠 Simple mental shortcut:

> **If you see "Data" or "Object" in the class name ➔ it interprets bytes.**  
> **Otherwise, it's raw byte handling.**
