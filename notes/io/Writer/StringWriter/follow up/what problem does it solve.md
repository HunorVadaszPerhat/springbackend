In simple terms, `StringWriter` solves the problem of **writing text to memory instead of a file or console**.

Imagine you're building a string piece by piece—like generating a report, composing a JSON or XML message, or capturing text output for testing—and you want to do it using standard Java writing tools. But instead of sending that text to a file, you just want to keep it in memory and get the final result as a `String`.

Before `StringWriter`, you'd have to manually manage string concatenation or create custom classes to do this. `StringWriter` gives you a ready-made, efficient way to:

- Collect text using the standard `Writer` methods.
- Store it in memory.
- Easily convert it to a `String` when you're done.

It makes it easy to build up text in memory, using familiar writing tools, without worrying about files, disk, or streams.
