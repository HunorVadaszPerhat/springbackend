In **simple terms**,  
**`PipedOutputStream`** solves this problem:

> **"How can one thread send data to another thread safely and easily?"**

Before it existed, if you wanted two threads to talk to each other (pass data from one to another), you had to build complicated systems:
- Manage shared variables carefully
- Write your own synchronization (lots of messy locking)
- Handle weird bugs like data corruption or deadlocks

**`PipedOutputStream`**, paired with **`PipedInputStream`**, gave developers a **simple tool**:
- One thread **writes** data like writing to a file.
- Another thread **reads** that data like reading from a file.
- **No need** to manually manage locks or worry about lost/corrupted data.
- It **blocks automatically** if the reader or writer gets too fast, keeping everything smooth.

ðŸ”¹ **Even simpler**:  
It lets two threads "talk" by **passing a stream of bytes**, without worrying about all the hard stuff.
