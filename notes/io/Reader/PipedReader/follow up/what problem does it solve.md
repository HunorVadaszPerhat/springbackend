In **simple terms**, `PipedReader` solves the problem of **letting two threads talk to each other using text**.

Imagine:

- One thread is writing messages (like a writer).
- Another thread is reading those messages (like a reader).

Instead of sharing a file or a big shared memory space (which is complicated and error-prone), `PipedReader` gives you a **safe, built-in pipe** between them.

### âœ… The problem it solves:
**"How can one thread send character data to another thread safely and easily?"**

It does this by:
- Providing a **private communication channel** (a pipe).
- Handling all the **waiting and syncing** so the reader waits if there's no data, and the writer waits if the pipe is full.
- Avoiding the need for **manual locks, shared variables, or complex synchronization.**

### ðŸ”§ Real-world analogy:
Think of it like a **walkie-talkie** between two people: one talks (writes), the other listens (reads), and they take turns. `PipedReader` is the listening side.
