In simple terms, **`BufferedReader`** solves the problem of **slow and clunky reading of text from files or other sources**.

Imagine you're trying to read a book, but you're only allowed to look at **one letter at a time**, and every time you want the next letter, someone has to go into a room and bring it to you. That would be **very slow and annoying**.

Now imagine that person brings you a whole **page at once**, and you can read from that page until it's empty. That’s **much faster and smoother**.

That’s what `BufferedReader` does:

- It **reads big chunks of text at once** and stores them in memory (a buffer), so your program doesn’t have to keep asking the file system for each character or line.
- It also gives you **easy tools to read one line at a time**, which is a very common way people want to read text.

Without it, reading from files or network input would be **slow** and **hard to manage**, especially for large amounts of text.
