### 📚 **“Lenny the Line-Counting Librarian”**

Meet **Lenny** — a smart little robot who lives in the library of your enterprise Java application. His job? To **read files, line by line**, and always tell you *exactly* what line he’s on. Think of him as a mix between a bookworm and a GPS for text files.

---

### 🧠 **What’s Lenny Good At?**

#### 1. 🧾 **Reading Lines, One by One**
Every time Lenny reads a line from a file (with `readLine()`), he quietly says to himself:
> “Okay, that was line 1. Now I’m on line 2.”

He **remembers the current line number** without you needing to tell him. That’s his superpower.

📦 In Java:
```java
String line = reader.readLine();
int lineNum = reader.getLineNumber(); // ← Lenny tells you the page number!
```

---

#### 2. 🧭 **Giving Directions**
Sometimes you need to know:
> “Hey Lenny, what page are we on?”

And he’ll reply:
> “We're on line 42!” (using `getLineNumber()`)

You can even tell him:
> “Pretend we’re starting from line 100 now.”

And Lenny will say:
> “Sure thing!” (`setLineNumber(100)`)

Just remember — it doesn’t move the file pointer, just resets the line **counter**.

---

#### 3. 🔖 **Marking His Place**
Lenny keeps a **bookmark**! If you say:
> “Mark this spot, Lenny.”

He nods and notes the position (`mark()`).

Later, you can say:
> “Go back to the mark.”

And Lenny returns right where he left off (`reset()`), **remembering not just the text, but the line number too**.

---

#### 4. 💡 **Daily Job in Enterprise Work**
In real life, Lenny helps Java devs:
- Parse **log files** and say:  
  *“This ERROR was on line 87.”*
- Scan **CSV files** and report:  
  *“Bad data in line 12, column 3.”*
- Analyze **source code**, pointing to:  
  *“Syntax error on line 45.”*

---

### ⚠️ **What Lenny Isn’t Great At**
- He gets confused if you make him **skip over content** using `skip()` — he may not count skipped lines correctly.
- He’s not made for **huge, high-speed stream processing** — more of a reliable assistant than a racecar.
- He only works with **character-based files**, not binary.

---

### 💼 Final Takeaway for Developers

**Think of `LineNumberReader` as your smart, line-tracking assistant**. Instead of writing your own code to count line numbers (and handling messy newline characters), just let Lenny do it.

He won’t write your whole parser — but he’s *really good* at telling you where you are in the file. In enterprise apps, that’s priceless for debugging, logging, and error tracking.
