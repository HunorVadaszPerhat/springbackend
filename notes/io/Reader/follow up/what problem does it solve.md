In simple terms, **`java.io.Reader` solves the problem of reading text (characters) from different sources** â€” like files, network connections, or in-memory strings â€” in a safe and consistent way.

Before `Reader`, Java only had `InputStream`, which reads **raw bytes**. But text isnâ€™t just bytes â€” itâ€™s encoded using things like UTF-8 or UTF-16. Reading text correctly meant manually converting bytes to characters, which was error-prone and hard to get right, especially with international characters (like Ã©, ä¸­, or ðŸ˜Š).

So `Reader` was introduced to:
- **Read characters, not bytes** â€” focusing on human-readable text.
- **Handle different character encodings**, so your text shows up correctly.
- **Make code easier to write and understand**, especially when dealing with files or user input.

In short:  
ðŸ“– `Reader` turns the complex, messy world of encoded bytes into clean, readable characters â€” so developers can work with text reliably.
