In **simple terms**, `PushbackReader` solves this problem:

> **“Oops! I read a character too soon — I need to put it back and read it again later.”**

Imagine you're reading a stream of characters, like reading a book letter by letter. Sometimes you read a character and realize:
- “Wait, that’s not what I expected!”
- “I need to check the next character to decide what to do — but if it’s not what I want, I need to *undo* that read.”

Normal readers in Java only let you move *forward*. Once you read a character, it’s gone — you can’t go back.  
But `PushbackReader` lets you **push characters back** into the stream, so the next time you read, you get the same character again.

### Real-World Example:
Let’s say you’re building a parser for a configuration file. You read a `/` and wonder:
> Is this a **comment** (like `//`)? Or is it just a division operator?

So you read the next character to check.  
If it **is** another `/`, great — it's a comment.  
If it's **not**, oops — you need to *put that character back*, because it’s part of the next real token.

### Summary:
🔁 **`PushbackReader` gives you a "rewind" button** for reading characters.  
It’s especially helpful in situations where you need to look ahead before deciding how to parse or interpret the input.
