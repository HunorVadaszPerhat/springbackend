In simple terms, **`FilterReader` solves the problem of customizing how text is read from a source** â€” like a file or a network connection â€” **without rewriting everything from scratch**.

### ðŸ§© The Problem Before `FilterReader`:
Imagine you're reading a big document and want to:
- Remove certain words (like profanity),
- Convert all text to uppercase,
- Count the number of lines,
- Or strip out HTML tags...

You could read the file manually, character by character, and add all your filtering logic right there. But that quickly becomes messy and repetitive â€” especially if you're working with multiple types of input (files, sockets, strings).

### âœ… What `FilterReader` Solves:
`FilterReader` lets you **wrap an existing reader** (like `FileReader`, `StringReader`, etc.) and **add your own custom behavior** on top â€” like cleaning, transforming, or tracking the text as it's being read.

It's like putting a smart "filter" or lens over your book: you still read the same book, but through your lens, certain words disappear, change color, or get counted.

So in short:
