🎨 **Cartoon Metaphor: "The Magic Straw That Drinks from Many Cups"**

---

**Scene:**

Imagine you're at a **party** 🥳 and there are **several cups** 🍹🍸🍷 lined up on a table.  
Each cup has some **different drink** inside — lemonade, cola, juice.

Now, instead of drinking from each cup one by one, you have a **special magic straw** 🧙‍♂️🥤.

Here's how the **magic straw** works:
- You put it into the **first cup** — sip sip sip — until the cup is empty.
- **Automatically**, the straw *jumps* 🪄 to the **next cup** — sip sip sip — no hands needed!
- Then it moves to the **third cup** — sip sip sip — all *without* you doing anything.

**To you**, it **feels like you're drinking from one big cup** — a single, endless drink! 🍹➔🍸➔🍷

You don't have to:
- Pick up cups one by one.
- Worry about when a drink runs out.
- Clean anything between sips.

🏗️ **In Java World:**
- Each **cup** = one **InputStream** (a file, a network stream, etc.).
- The **magic straw** = the **`SequenceInputStream`**.
- You **read** from the straw — it handles moving between cups (streams) automatically.
- You just keep sipping (reading) — *no worries when one stream ends!*

---

# 🎯 **Summary:**

**`SequenceInputStream`** =
> A *magic straw* that lets you **drink (read) smoothly from many cups (streams)**, **one after another**, without lifting a finger.
