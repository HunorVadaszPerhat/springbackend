In simple terms:

ðŸ‘‰ **`SequenceInputStream` solves the problem of combining multiple input streams into one continuous flow.**

Imagine you have **several files**, or **chunks of data** coming from different places, but you want to **read them as if they were one big file** â€” without manually opening, closing, and switching between them yourself.

Before `SequenceInputStream`, you had to:
- Read from one stream.
- Notice when it ends.
- Close it.
- Open the next stream.
- Repeat...

It was annoying, messy, and easy to make mistakes (like forgetting to close streams properly).

`SequenceInputStream` **automates all of that**:
- You give it a list of streams.
- You just keep reading like it's one long stream.
- Behind the scenes, it switches to the next stream for you when one finishes.

**âœ…** You get simple, clean, uninterrupted reading â€” no matter how many pieces you're joining together.
