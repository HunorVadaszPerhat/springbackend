In simple terms, `java.io.BufferedInputStream` solves the problem of slow, inefficient data reading by reading larger chunks of data into memory at once, rather than one byte at a time.

Imagine reading a book by fetching one letter at a timeâ€”very slow. Instead, a BufferedInputStream is like grabbing a whole sentence or paragraph at once, making reading faster and more efficient.
