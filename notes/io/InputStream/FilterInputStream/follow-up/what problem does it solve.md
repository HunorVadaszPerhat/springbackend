In simple terms, `java.io.FilterInputStream` helps you add extra features or behaviors to an existing input stream. It acts like a wrapper, meaning it takes a regular stream (like reading from a file) and lets you enhance it—for example, to buffer data, filter out specific content, or convert data into another form—without changing the original stream itself.

This solves the problem of extending the behavior of existing streams easily, without having to rewrite or duplicate code.
