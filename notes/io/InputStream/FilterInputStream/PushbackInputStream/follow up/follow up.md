# 🧩 What is `PushbackInputStream`?

Imagine you are **reading a book**, but you realize you **turned one page too far**.  
You want to **put the page back** and read it again carefully.  
**That's exactly what `PushbackInputStream` does — but for bytes!**

---

# 🎯 Why Do We Need It?

Normally when you read from an `InputStream`, once you read a byte, **it’s gone** — you can’t go back.

But sometimes you read something and think:
> "Wait, I wasn't ready for that byte yet!"  
> "I need to look at it again."

👉 `PushbackInputStream` **lets you push a byte back**, so the next time you read, you get the same byte again.

---

# 📦 How It Works (Very Simply)

- **You read** from it like any other InputStream.
- **If you need to undo**, you call `unread(byte)`, and it puts the byte back.
- The next read will **give you the pushed-back byte first**, before continuing normally.

It’s like a **small backpack** that can hold a few bytes you "regret" reading.

---

# 🛠 Real-Life Example

Suppose you're writing a program that reads letters and numbers.

You read a character and find it's a number when you expected a letter.

Instead of panicking, you **push the number back** and let a different part of the code handle numbers later.

# 🔥 In One Line:

> **`PushbackInputStream` lets you “peek ahead” by reading and then pushing bytes back if you change your mind.**

---

# 📜 Quick Example Code

```java
PushbackInputStream pbis = new PushbackInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt"));

int b = pbis.read();
if (b != -1) {
    if (b == 'A') {
        // Good, expected A
    } else {
        pbis.unread(b);  // Oops, not A, put it back!
    }
}
```

# ✨ Simple Metaphor

| Action | Real World | In PushbackInputStream |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Read a byte | Flip a page | `read()` |
| Put a page back | Regret and place the page back | `unread()` |

# 🍬 **Normal InputStream = One-way Conveyor Belt**

Imagine a conveyor belt with candies moving forward.  
Each candy is a **byte**.

- You take a candy off the belt (you call `read()`).
- 🍬 **You eat it**.
- It's **gone forever** — you can't put it back!

**Conveyor belt keeps moving** → you can only grab the next candy.

---

# 🍬🔄 **PushbackInputStream = Conveyor Belt with a Rewind Button**

Now, imagine you have a special button:

- You grab a candy 🍬.
- You realize: **"Oops! I wasn't ready for this candy!"**
- You press the **rewind button** 🔄.
- **The candy rolls back onto the belt** so you can pick it up again later.

That **rewind** button is what **`unread()`** does!

---

# 🎯 **Summary in Fun Terms:**

| Concept | Normal InputStream | PushbackInputStream |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Grab a candy (byte) | Candy is gone forever 🍬❌ | You can push it back! 🍬🔄 |
| Control | Only forward ➡️ | Forward ➡️ **and** backward 🔙 (a little bit) |
| Feel | Like eating | Like taste-testing! |

---

# 📜 Super Simple Example:

```java
PushbackInputStream pbis = new PushbackInputStream(new FileInputStream("candies.txt"));
int candy = pbis.read(); // 🍬 Take a candy
if (candy != expectedCandy) {
    pbis.unread(candy); // 🔄 Push candy back if not ready!
}
```

---

# 🚀 Why This Matters:

When **parsing data** (like reading a file format, a protocol, or structured input), sometimes you **peek ahead** and realize:
- "Oops, wrong type!"
- "Wait, I need to handle this differently."

✅ `PushbackInputStream` lets you **fix that** by putting bytes back, without losing data.
