`java.io.PushbackInputStream` solves the problem of **needing to “peek” at bytes ahead in a stream without losing them**.

- **Without it**: once you read a byte (or two) to see what’s next—say you’re parsing—you’ve consumed them. If you decide you weren’t ready for those bytes, you’d have to reopen or buffer the whole stream yourself.
- **With it**: you wrap your normal `InputStream` in a `PushbackInputStream`. You can read ahead to inspect the next byte(s), and if you decide you’re not ready for them, you simply “push them back” with `unread(...)`. The stream hands them right back on the next read call.

It’s like reading a word in a book, then putting a bookmark back on those letters so you can re-read them later exactly as they were.

Exactly—that’s the idea. With a `PushbackInputStream` you can:

1. **Read ahead**
   ```java
   int b = pushback.read();
   ```
2. **Inspect or decide** whether you actually want to consume that byte (or bytes) or treat it differently.
3. **Push it back** if you’re not ready to consume it:
   ```java
   pushback.unread(b);
   ```
4. **Continue** reading normally, and that pushed-back byte will be the next one returned.

### Why that helps

- **Conditional parsing**: Peek at the next byte(s) to see if they mark the start of a special token. If not, push them back and treat them as ordinary data.
- **Graceful fallback**: Try parsing a multi-byte sequence; if it doesn’t match what you expect, push it all back and hand it off to a different parser or handler.

### Simple example

```java
InputStream raw = new FileInputStream("data.bin");
PushbackInputStream pb = new PushbackInputStream(raw, /*pushback buffer size*/ 2);

int first = pb.read();
if (first == 0xAB) {
    // Looks like our special header byte—proceed with special parsing
    int second = pb.read();
    // ... parse two-byte header ...
} else {
    // Not our header—put it back and read normally
    pb.unread(first);
    int normal = pb.read();
    // ... handle as regular data ...
}
```

Here, if the first byte isn’t `0xAB`, we “unread” it so the stream is just as if we never looked. Then we switch to normal processing.

A `PushbackInputStream` gives you:

1. **Peek ahead**: read one or more bytes.
2. **Conditional check**: decide what those bytes mean (e.g., “is this my header?”).
3. **Push back**: if you’re not ready (or they don’t match), call `unread(...)` to put them back.
4. **Continue**: the next `read()` will return those same bytes, so you can handle them normally or with a different parser.

It’s the classic “look before you leap” pattern for byte streams.
