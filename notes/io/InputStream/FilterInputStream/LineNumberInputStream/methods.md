Here’s a **comprehensive and structured categorization** of the `java.io.LineNumberInputStream` methods in **Java SE 21**, tailored for **enterprise-level Java development**. We’ll break down the class by **functional categories**, **usage tags**, and explain **which methods truly matter** — especially when dealing with **legacy systems**, **code audits**, or **modernization tasks**.

---

## 📦 Categorized Method Breakdown

---

### 🔹 1. **Line Number Management**

These methods deal directly with the **core purpose** of the class — managing and accessing the current line number.

| Method | Description | Tag |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `int getLineNumber()` | Returns the current line number being tracked. Starts at 0 and increments on line terminators. | **Essential** |
| `void setLineNumber(int lineNumber)` | Manually sets the line number counter. Useful if you’re resuming parsing from a known state. | **Advanced** |

> 🧠 **Real Use**: These are the **primary reasons** you'd use `LineNumberInputStream`. Especially valuable in **parsers**, **interpreters**, or **log file readers** where line numbers provide context.

---

### 🔹 2. **Reading Data**

Core read operations — these **override** `InputStream` methods to inject line-counting logic.

| Method | Description | Tag |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `int read()` | Reads a single byte and increments line number on line terminators. | **Essential** |
| `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` | Reads into a byte array and detects line endings across chunks. | **Essential** |
| `long skip(long n)` | Skips `n` bytes, updating line numbers accordingly if newlines are skipped. | **Advanced** |

> ⚠️ **Caveat**: These methods are byte-based. They **don’t handle multibyte encodings** (like UTF-8), making them **dangerous** in modern systems that use international character sets.

---

### 🔹 3. **Marking and Resetting**

Inherited from `FilterInputStream`, these are useful for buffering and reprocessing.

| Method | Description | Tag |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `void mark(int readlimit)` | Marks the current position in the stream along with the line number. | **Rarely Used** |
| `void reset()` | Resets the stream to the last marked position and restores the line number. | **Rarely Used** |
| `boolean markSupported()` | Returns `true`. Indicates that marking is supported. | **Rarely Used** |

> 🔄 These methods are part of the **Java I/O contract**, but rarely leveraged in enterprise-level work unless building **custom stream processors** or DSL parsers.

---

### 🔹 4. **Stream Lifecycle**

Standard lifecycle and compatibility methods from `InputStream`.

| Method | Description | Tag |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `int available()` | Returns an estimate of available bytes. Not guaranteed accurate for line tracking. | **Legacy** |
| `void close()` | Closes the wrapped input stream. | **Essential** |
| `int read(byte[] b)` | Inherited, reads into a full byte array. May or may not respect line numbers properly. | **Legacy** |

> 🛑 These methods mostly exist to fulfill interface contracts and are **non-critical** to the line-counting functionality.

## 🛠️ Summary for Real-World Usage

In real-world enterprise applications, the usage of `LineNumberInputStream` is **rare** and typically confined to:

- **Legacy systems** built in early Java versions (pre-1.1).
- **Byte-based input sources** where line numbering was manually managed.
- **Quick scripts or internal tooling** where full encoding support wasn’t required.

However, in **modern applications**, it’s generally recommended to use:

- ✅ `LineNumberReader` — for character-aware line tracking.
- ✅ `BufferedReader` + `readLine()` + manual line counter — for more control and flexibility.

---

## ✅ Final Advice for Enterprise Developers

> **👷 Use Only for Legacy Compatibility**

- `LineNumberInputStream` is **deprecated since Java 1.1**, and its use in new code is **strongly discouraged**.
- It **cannot handle modern character encodings**, making it unsafe for globalized applications.

> **💡 Prefer Character Streams**

- If you’re processing human-readable data (e.g., configs, source code, logs), prefer `LineNumberReader` or build your own wrapper using `BufferedReader`.

> **🔍 For Migration Work**

- If your enterprise codebase still uses `LineNumberInputStream`, it’s a strong candidate for **refactoring** or **modernization**.
- Watch out for assumptions about newline formats (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) when migrating.

> **🧪 Test Edge Cases**

- In legacy integrations, test for:
    - Incorrect line numbers when `\r\n` is split across reads.
    - Incompatibility with multibyte characters (especially in UTF-8 streams).
    - Broken line counters after using `reset()` or `skip()`.

## 📘 TL;DR

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Use in New Code | ❌ **Do Not Use** |
| Legacy Support | ✅ **Yes, if maintaining existing systems** |
| Modern Alternative | ✅ `LineNumberReader` |
| Main Limitation | ❌ No character encoding awareness |
| Enterprise Tip | 🔍 Flag for refactoring in code reviews |
