`java.io.LineNumberInputStream` solves the problem of **keeping track of which line you’re on** when you’re reading raw byte data.

- **Without it**: you’d have to manually watch for `\n` (newline) bytes and increment your own counter each time.
- **With it**: you wrap your existing `InputStream` in a `LineNumberInputStream`, and it automatically counts lines for you. You can then call `getLineNumber()` at any point to find out which line of the input you’re currently reading.

It’s essentially a convenience wrapper that saves you from writing and maintaining your own line-counting logic.
