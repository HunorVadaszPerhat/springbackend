In simple terms, `FileInputStream` solves the problem of **reading data directly from files into a Java program**. 
It provides an easy way for Java applications to open files and read their contents as a stream of raw bytes,
allowing programmers to process file data efficiently without worrying about how different operating systems handle files internally.
