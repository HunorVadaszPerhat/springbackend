In simple terms:

`java.io.InputStream` solves the problem of **reading data from a source**, like a file, a network connection, or even memory, **one piece at a time** (usually one byte at a time).

Before something like `InputStream`, every type of input (files, network, etc.) might have needed totally different code to read from it. `InputStream` gives a **common way** to handle all kinds of input, so your code can read from any source without worrying too much about *where* the data is coming from.

**Even simpler:**  
Imagine `InputStream` like a straw â€” it lets your program "sip" data from somewhere, little by little, without needing to know the whole drink (file, network, etc.) at once.
